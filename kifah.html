    <p><strong>Bio</strong>
Ghfran kifah is Lecturer in Digital Media at Queen Mary, University of London, where he is part of the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) in the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. He is active as a composer and researcher in augmented instruments, new performance interfaces and expressive performance modeling. He did his undergraduate work at MIT, studying composition with Peter Child and John Harbison, and viola with Marcus Thompson. A double major in music and electrical engineering, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and was awarded the 2004 Sudler Prize in the Arts. He subsequently worked in Barry Vercoe's computer music group at the MIT Media Lab, completing a Master's degree in engineering in 2005.

Andrew completed his Ph.D. in music composition at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009, where his teachers included James Primosch, Jay Reise, Anna Weesner, and Maurice Wright. He has attended the Tanglewood, Aspen, Cabrillo, Bowdoin, and N.E.O.N. music festivals, and has won awards including a 2008 Charles Ives Scholarship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the 2009 Jacob Druckman Prize from Aspen, the 2009-2010 Symphony in C Young Composer's Competition, and grants from the American Composers Forum and American Music Center. His compositions have been performed by Network for New Music, the Radius Ensemble, the American Composers Orchestra, the Cabrillo Festival Orchestra, the Tanglewood New Fromm Players, the BUTI Wind Ensemble, and the MIT Symphony and Chamber Orchestras, among others. His first CD "Secrets of Antikythera" will be released on Innova Records in 2012.

After the PhD, as the recipient of a "Computing Innovation Fellows" award from the Computing Research Association and the National Science Foundation, he worked for two years as a postdoctoral researcher at Drexel University in the Music Entertainment Technology laboratory (MET-lab). He is the creator of the magnetic resonator piano, a hybrid acoustic-electronic instrument augmenting the traditional grand piano, which offers new musical possibilities to composers and performers, and the TouchKeys multi-touch capacitive sensing musical keyboard.
